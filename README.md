# O365UserLicenseReport
PowerShell script that pulls data from Office 365 on Microsoft Project, Visio, and Office 365 E3

**language:**
- exclusively PowerShell

**Reason for script:**
- I wanted a way to pull information of who is licensed while minimizing two tasks. 1.) signing into the Office 365 portal everytime to download the report. 2.) not have to search for the same command (notes or internet) to pull the information.

**Goal**
- create a modular script for pulling of simple data on licensing of Office 365 and users that I would provide for my manager
- easily keep track of what users are licensed that management can sign off on.
